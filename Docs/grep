NAME
       grep - print lines that match patterns

SYNOPSIS
       grep [OPTION...] PATTERNS [FILE...]
     

DESCRIPTION
       grep  searches  for  PATTERNS  in  each  FILE.   PATTERNS is one or more patterns separated by
       newline characters, and grep prints each line that  matches  a  pattern.   Typically  PATTERNS
       should be quoted when grep is used in a shell command.
              Print  NUM  lines  of  output context.  Places a line containing a group separator (--)
              between contiguous groups of matches.  With the -o or --only-matching option, this  has
              no effect and a warning is given.
