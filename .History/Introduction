Nolan Booth is an expert thief of lost treasures, dedicating his life to finding, stealing and selling these relics of history.
In order to be able to carry out these spectacular hits, he always carries a backpack, with different gadgets, and a smartwatch,
with a voice assistant to be able to make quick inquiries on the internet in the middle of a robbery.

Booth is obsessed with Cleopatra's 3 eggs, he has managed to steal 2 of them, but the whereabouts of the third one are unknown.
According to the rumors he has heard, the third egg is hidden in a room in the pyramid of the greatest pharaoh that Egypt has known,
the pyramid of Cheops.

His obsession with these 3 relics has led Booth to search for Cleopatra's lost egg in Egypt.

Booth is at the airport in Egypt, carrying his backpack fully prepared for any type of unforeseen event. He must discover how to get to Giza,
where the three great pyramids are located. Luckily he takes his smartwatch to 100% battery. (Jarvis, help!)
